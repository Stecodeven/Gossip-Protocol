# Gossip-Protocol
An interesting protocol in P2P networks. Collaborated with [Jun13tm](http://github.com/Jun13tm).  

Provided implementation is a simple simulation of a multi-agent chatroom, which gives me more sense of P2P network and more exposure to its broad application such as in Blockchains, the propagation of blocks info and transactions info.
